Features
========

DFBA
----
Simulator for dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) of SBML model.
For more information see also `<http://github.com/matthiaskoenig/dfba>`_.

SBML report
-----------
HTML report of SBML models. This provides overview of the model contents.

modelcreator
------------
The modelcreator provides utilities for the creation of SBML models.
Supports `comp` and `fbc` models. Model information is managed in python data
structures which are used to create the models.

* `Cell.py`: basic model information
* `Reactions.py`: reaction information

Models can extend other models and reuse information from
defined models.

SBML annotator
--------------
Helper functions for the annotation of SBML models.
Annotations are hereby defined in separate annotation files with
annotations being matched to ids based on regular expression matching.

SBML interpolation
------------------
Helper functions for working with data interpolation in SBML models.
